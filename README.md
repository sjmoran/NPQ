This code is an implementation of the Neighbourhood Preserving Quantisation (NPQ) model introduced in the paper:

[Sean Moran, Victor Lavrenko and Miles Osborne. Neighbourhood Preserving Quantisation for LSH. SIGIR, 2013](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2484162)

Prerequisites:

1. Matlab

#Usage

1. Obtain the pre-processed dataset files for MNIST, CIFAR-10 and NUSWIDE here: 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pvso066sqd2z8ja/AABu7dxMx92lhlLLXLUpg_jMa?dl=0

2. Edit the properties in initialise.m to fit your system and requirements (e.g. hashcode length, dataset, amount of supervision, paths to datasets and results directory etc).

3. run_quant.m
